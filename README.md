## 🎖️Welcome Space Cadets!
This is the Agentic AI Hackathon 2125 Game.

## 👾Story
The year is 2125.

A hundred years ago, we sent out unmanned deep-space probes in search of worlds suitable for colonization.<br>One of these probes was found. Found by “Them”.

“They” intercepted the probe, tampered with it, and attempted to open it. The resulting explosion must have killed hundreds of them.<br>
They saw this as an act of war and responded with deadly force. Nothing could stop them.<br>
War broke out across the entire sector and has raged for the past century.<br>
Now, they plan to attack humanity’s last bastion. The Earth itself.

But today marks the end of their plans.<br>
Today, we will no longer retreat!<br>
Today, we take back what is ours!

## 🤔Situation
You are Space Cadets of the last human space fleet.<br>Your spaceship name is CSS Titan (CSS is for Command Space Ship).

On behalf of all people, we are to fight humanity's "last battle"!

Communication to other spaceships is broken.
* "They" destroyed our default communication channels.
* BUT: There is watsonx, a 2025 good old "earth age" software.
* watsonx looks surprisingly good for a 100-year-old human written software.

With watsonx, we can orchestrate other spaceships by indirectly tapping into their onboard control systems.
  * Orchestrated spaceships (so-called "Agents") use the Agent Communication Protocol (ACP).
  * "They" classified the ACP as "not harmful". Fools.

Our space fleet consists of
  * Several functional spaceships that we can orchestrate
  * Many defender spaceships, which we can send out if we are under attack

## 👽Problem
We are under attack!<br>
We need the CSS Titan to **create battle plans** for appearing enemy spaceships.

All you need, is the following mission guide.

The survival of humanity depends on you!

## 📖 Rules
You will compete in several missions.<br>
After each mission, call a Space Instructor to get your solution verified.<br>
You will be rated with Space Points.<br>
There is no exact solution on how to solve the missions.<br>
Creativity wins.<br>
Good luck, Space Cadets!
